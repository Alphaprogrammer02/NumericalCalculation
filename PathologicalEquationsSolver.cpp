/*
The expression A.colPivHouseholderQr().solve(b) in Eige
n allows us to solve a system of equations, even when t
he system is pathological or ill-conditioned. Let's bre
ak down the steps and understand how it works:

1. A.colPivHouseholderQr(): This performs a QR decompos
ition of matrix A using the column-pivoting variant of 
the Householder QR factorization. The QR decomposition 
decomposes matrix A into the product of an orthogonal m
atrix Q and an upper triangular matrix R, such that A =
 QR. The column pivoting ensures stability and reliabil
ity, especially in the presence of highly correlated or
 nearly dependent columns in matrix A.

2. .solve(b): This method solves the system of equation
s using the QR decomposition computed in the previous s
tep. It takes the right-hand side vector b and efficien
tly computes the solution vector x that satisfies the e
quation Ax = b.

Eigen's QR decomposition with the column-pivoting varia
nt is particularly useful for solving pathological or i
ll-conditioned systems of equations. A system is consid
ered pathological when it exhibits one or more of the f
ollowing characteristics:

- Highly correlated or nearly dependent columns in the 
coefficient matrix A.
- Small or zero eigenvalues, which can cause numerical 
instability.
- Large condition number, indicating sensitivity to sma
ll changes in the input.

The column pivoting technique helps in handling these s
ituations by rearranging the columns of matrix A during
 the decomposition to ensure stability and accurate sol
utions, even when the system is pathological.

By using A.colPivHouseholderQr().solve(b), Eigen's QR d
ecomposition with column pivoting is applied to solve t
he system of equations in a robust and efficient manner
, providing reliable solutions even in challenging scen
arios.

It's important to note that while column pivoting can i
mprove stability, it cannot overcome fundamental issues
 like rank deficiency or singularities in the system. I
n such cases, additional considerations or techniques m
ay be required to handle the specific problems associat
ed with the system.

The expression residual.lpNorm<Eigen::Infinity>() calcu
lates the maximum norm (also known as the L-infinity no
rm or the supremum norm) of the residual vector.

The L-infinity norm of a vector is defined as the maxim
um absolute value among its elements. It represents the
 magnitude of the largest component in the vector. Math
ematically, for a vector v with elements v1, v2, ..., v
n, the L-infinity norm is given by:

||v||<sub>âˆž</sub> = max(|v1|, |v2|, ..., |vn|) 

By obtaining the L-infinity norm, you can assess the ma
ximum error between the predicted values (obtained by m
ultiplying matrix A with the solution vector x) and the
 actual right-hand side values in the system of equatio
ns.
